<h1>RESEARCH INTERESTS</h1>

<p> I am interested in probability, combinatorics, graph theory, algorithms, and applied statistics. For my undergrad mathematics
    senior works, I wrote two theses on algebraic combinatorics and Brownian motion respectively. I have also worked on projects related
    to 3D reconstruction and astrostatistics.
