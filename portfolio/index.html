<h1>RESEARCH INTERESTS</h1>

<p> I am broadly interested in probability, combinatorics, graph theory, algorithms, machine learning, and applied statistics. For my undergrad mathematics
    senior works, I wrote two theses on algebraic combinatorics and Brownian motion respectively. I have also worked on projects related
    to 3D reconstruction and astrostatistics.

<h2> 3D Reconstruction Software</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, we implemented 3DKinect, an easy-to-use software
    that streamlines the seential components in the 3D reconstruction pipeline. Our software has five major functionalities:
     (a) upload, visualize, capture, and save point cloud data. (b) View recorded RGB-D image and use mouse to rotate and zoom the point cloud data on screen; (c) change the size and color of the
    points on screen; (d) edit and crop existing point clouds. (e)stitch multiple point cloud data together(using the Iterative Closest Point Algorithm) 
    and demonstrate the process of registration step by step.

<h2>Astrostatistics: Quasar Variability</h2>
<p> Quasars are highly variable astronomical sources and there are many statistical metrics(variability indices) that quantify how variable a quasar is.
In this project, we studied the imaging data of more than 330,000 quasars from the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS), which provided magnitude 
repeatedly over 8 years. The primary goal of this research is to determine whether there is a significant difference in the statistical distributions of variability indices between radio-loud and
radio-quiet quasars.
</p>
 <p>We computed various types of variability indices built data visualizations for each to demonstrate the statistical difference between radio-quiet and radio-
loud quasars. While most of the variability indices of these two populations are distributed in a similar manner, the results of Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Anderson-Darling test
both suggest that Robust median statistics and SB variability metrics could reject the null hypothesis (same population) at less than 1% level, which may point to physical differences in accretion
behavior.

<h2>Expository Writings in Mathematics</h2>
  
<h3> <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=17pjkWAlPFEv1R1vsN1Ja55ny77ZTIhVl">1).The Chevalley-Warning Theorem: Its Proofs, Generalisations, and Applications</a></h3>
  
  <p> Abstract: The Chevalley-Warning Theorem states that if we are given a common zero of a
system of polynomials with n variables over a finite field, and the sum of the degrees of
each polynomial is smaller than n, the number of common zeros of these polynomials
is a multiple of the characteristic of the field. In this paper, we give an introduction
to Chevalley-Warning Theorem and walk through different proofs of the theorem. We
also discuss how mathematicians have generalized this theorem and produced more
powerful results recently. This paper analyzes the proofs of four distinct generalizations of
Chevalley-type theorems. We give a collection of applications of Chevalley-
Warning Theorem to different fields of mathematics, such as combinatorics, group theory, graph theory, and affine geometry .

<h3> <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18Kv9p3t8beBeNIFpGXNIuBRIS10MLuXn">2).Hausdorff Dimension and Fractal Properties of Brownian Path</a></h3>
  <p> Abstract: Hausdorff dimension is a convenient tool that provides a description of how much
space a set occupies in d-dimensional Euclidean space. It is based on Hausdorff measure and has the advantage
of being well-defined for every set. In this paper, we give an introduction to Hausdorff
dimension and measure, along with multiple useful examples and techniques. In section
4, we investigate how Hausdorff dimension can be applied to the study of the fractal
properties of Brownian Path. The mass distribution principle, the energy method, and the Frostmanâ€™s Lemma
are introduced to determine the Hausdorff dimensions of zeros, range, and graph of Brownian path.
