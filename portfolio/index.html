<h1>RESEARCH INTERESTS</h1>

<p> I am interested in probability, combinatorics, graph theory, algorithms, and applied statistics. For my undergrad mathematics
    senior works, I wrote two theses on algebraic combinatorics and Brownian motion respectively. I have also worked on projects related
    to 3D reconstruction and astrostatistics.

  <p> Abstract: The Chevalley-Warning Theorem states that if we are given a common zero of a
system of polynomials with n variables over a finite field, and the sum of the degrees of
each polynomial is smaller than n, the number of common zeros of these polynomials
is a multiple of the characteristic of the field. In this paper, we give an introduction
to Chevalley-Warning Theorem and walk through different proofs of the theorem. We
also discuss how mathematicians have generalized this theorem and produced more
powerful results. This paper analyzes the proofs of four distinct generalizations of
Chevalley-type theorems. We give a collection of multiple applications of Chevalley-
Warning Theorem to different fields of mathematics. The paper ends with a summary
of each section.
