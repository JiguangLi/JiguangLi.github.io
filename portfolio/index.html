<h1>RESEARCH INTERESTS</h1>

<p>
 I am interested in applying novel statistical methods to tackle real-world problems such as astronomy, operation research, and social sciences. My research interests include statistical computing, machine learning, optimization techniques, and high-dimensional statistics.
</p>

<h2>Astrostatistics</h2>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/JiguangLi/Blaze_Function">1).Two Methods to Remove Blaze Function from Echelle Spectrum Orders</a></h3>
  <p>
  This project involves the Python implementation of the Alpha-shape Fitting to Spectrum algorithm (AFS) and the Alpha-shape and Lab Source Fitting to Spectrum algorithm (ALSFS) proposed by Xin Xu et al (2019), whose paper is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10065.pdf"> here </a>.
  The AFS and the ALSFS algorithms can be used to flatten the spectrum continuum, an important data analysis step in spectroscopic analysis.
 </p>
 <p>
  Both algorithms start by approximating the shape of a spectrum using a generalization of convex hull called alpha shape. Then they apply
  local polynomial regresssion to estimate the corresponding blaze function. The key difference between these two algorithms is that AFS
  does not require a lab source spectrum, whereas ALSFS is preferred when such a reference is available. You can check out a working demo
  of these two algorithms <a href="https://github.com/JiguangLi/Blaze_Function/blob/master/demo.pdf">here </a>.

 <h3> 2).Quasar Variability </h3>
<p> Quasars are highly variable astronomical sources and there are many statistical metrics(variability indices) that quantify how variable a quasar is.
In this project, we studied the imaging data of more than 330,000 quasars from the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS), which provided magnitude information
repeatedly over 8 years. The primary goal of this research is to determine whether there is a significant difference in the statistical distributions of variability indices between radio-loud and
radio-quiet quasars.
</p>
 <p> We computed eleven different variability indices to compare the difference in variability between radio-quiet and radio-
loud quasars. While most of the variability indices of these two populations are distributed in a similar manner, the results of Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Anderson-Darling test
both suggest that Robust median statistics and SB variability metrics could both reject the null hypothesis (same population) at less than 1% level, even though the statistical distributions
of these two statistical metrics look alike by the following histograms.
 </p>

<p>This result may point to physical differences in accretion behavior between these two populations of quasars. More information about this project can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s9yV_41rw2_1R8lJbcArTS0LL0kR1LJc"> here </a>.</p>

  <h2>Expository Writings in Probablity/Statistics</h2>
  <h3> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OOzX-SdrolrFNSC6Xei71fm8YDmnv1_m/view?usp=sharing">1) Robust Estimation of Wasserstein Distance via Factored Couplings </a></h3>
    <p>
  The goal of this project is to provide a detailed exposition of a recent <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/forrow19a/forrow19a.pdf">paper </a> on statisti-
  cal optimal transport , in which the authors purpose a robust estimator to approximate
  Wasserstein distance between two probability distributions under high-dimensional sampling
  noise.
   </p>
   <p>
  One challenging problem in optimal transport is to estimate the Wasserstein distances between two probability distributions, which can suffer greatly from the curse of dimensionality and sampling noise
  when adopting a naive plugin method. One interesting point about this paper is that instead of
  adding an entropic penalty to alleviate measurement noise, the authors impose an intuitive structural assumptions on possible couplings, which yield a more robust estimator of 2−Wasserstein distance.

   <h3> <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18Kv9p3t8beBeNIFpGXNIuBRIS10MLuXn">2).Hausdorff Dimension and Fractal Properties of Brownian Path</a></h3>
     <p> Abstract: Hausdorff dimension is a convenient tool that provides a description of how much
   space a set occupies in d-dimensional Euclidean space. It is based on Hausdorff measure and has the advantage
   of being well-defined for every set. In this paper, we give an introduction to Hausdorff
   dimension and measure, along with multiple useful examples and techniques. In section
   4, we investigate how Hausdorff dimension can be applied to the study of the fractal
   properties of Brownian Path. The mass distribution principle, the energy method, and the Frostman’s Lemma
   are introduced to determine the Hausdorff dimensions of zeros, range, and graph of Brownian path.

    <h2> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qoNci86LfVH5hYBLwcNyNH8ewJEWJISf/view?usp=sharing"> Convex Optimization on Fastest Mixing Markov Chain </a></h3>
      <p> In this optimization class project, I explored the problem of finding the transition probabilities on the edges of
a graph that gives the fastest mixing Markov chain as proposed by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/fmmc.pdf"> Stephen Boyd, Persi Diaconis, and Lin Xiao </a>.
The other novel part of this project was that I used weak duality to deduce the optimal transition probability matrix P* for star graphs analytically (See Conjecture 5.2). My proof of this conjecture was
inspired by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/fmmc_path.pdf"> the proof a similar result for line graph.  </a>

<h3> <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=17pjkWAlPFEv1R1vsN1Ja55ny77ZTIhVl">1).The Chevalley-Warning Theorem: Its Proofs, Generalisations, and Applications</a></h3>

  <p> Abstract: The Chevalley-Warning Theorem states that if we are given a common zero of a
system of polynomials with n variables over a finite field, and the sum of the degrees of
each polynomial is smaller than n, the number of common zeros of these polynomials
is a multiple of the characteristic of the field. In this paper, we give an introduction
to Chevalley-Warning Theorem and walk through different proofs of the theorem. We
also discuss how mathematicians have generalized this theorem and produced more
powerful results recently. This paper analyzes the proofs of four distinct generalizations of
Chevalley-type theorems. We give a collection of applications of Chevalley-
Warning Theorem to different fields of mathematics, such as combinatorics, group theory, graph theory, and affine geometry .

<h3>2.) 3D Reconstruction Software</h3>
   <p>
     In this project, we implemented 3DKinect, an easy-to-use software
     that streamlines the seential components in the 3D reconstruction pipeline. Our software has five major functionalities:
      (a) upload, visualize, capture, and save point cloud data. (b) View recorded RGB-D image and use mouse to rotate and zoom the point cloud data on screen; (c) change the size and color of the
     points on screen; (d) edit and crop existing point clouds. (e)stitch multiple point cloud data together(using the Iterative Closest Point Algorithm)
     and demonstrate the process of registration step by step.
