<h1>RESEARCH INTERESTS</h1>

<p> I am interested in probability, combinatorics, graph theory, algorithms, and applied statistics. For my undergrad mathematics
    senior works, I wrote two theses on algebraic combinatorics and Brownian motion respectively. I have also worked on projects related
    to 3D reconstruction and astrostatistics.

<h3> <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=17pjkWAlPFEv1R1vsN1Ja55ny77ZTIhVl">1).The Chevalley-Warning Theorem: Its Proofs, Generalisations, and Applications</a></h3>
  
  <p> Abstract: The Chevalley-Warning Theorem states that if we are given a common zero of a
system of polynomials with n variables over a finite field, and the sum of the degrees of
each polynomial is smaller than n, the number of common zeros of these polynomials
is a multiple of the characteristic of the field. In this paper, we give an introduction
to Chevalley-Warning Theorem and walk through different proofs of the theorem. We
also discuss how mathematicians have generalized this theorem and produced more
powerful results recently. This paper analyzes the proofs of four distinct generalizations of
Chevalley-type theorems. We give a collection of applications of Chevalley-
Warning Theorem to different fields of mathematics, such as combinatorics, group theory, graph theory, and affine geometry .

  <p> Abstract: Hausdorff dimension is a convenient tool that provides a description of how much
space a set occupies in d-dimensional Euclidean space. It is based on Hausdorff measure and has the advantage
of being well-defined for every set. In this paper, we give an introduction to Hausdorff
dimension and measure, along with multiple useful examples and techniques. In section
4, we investigate how Hausdorff dimension can be applied to the study of the fractal
properties of Brownian Path. The mass distribution principle, the energy method, and the Frostmanâ€™s Lemma
are introduced to determine the Hausdorff dimensions of zeros, range, and graph of Brownian path.
